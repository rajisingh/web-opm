**Web OPM** is the next generation of OPCAT desktop version CASE tool that leverages on Object Process Methodology (OPM). It allows any engineer to create models of the system under development, run conceptual simulation for validation and verification, run animation to present the model to stakeholders, and save the models at the Serverâ€™s repository or download to the PC.

**Main Features**:
  * Single model that enables clear and concise expression of hardware, software,humans and regulation.
  * Complexity management by refinement/abstraction mechanisms that include in-zooming/out-zooming, unfolding/folding and suppression/expression.
  * Animated system and product simulation for design-level conceptual debugging and effective early error avoidance or trapping, resulting in huge tangible time and money savings down the road.
  * Automated generation of compatible models: UML, SysML, BOM.
